## Project-Orchid

**POTENTIALLY INCOMPLETE PROJECT**

This is a *test run* for a project I have been considering building for a while. Like most other projects on my github, this will most likely serve as a means to learn how to complete a certain task and then I will move on...

### Project Goals

- [x] point and click movement
- [ ] obstruction detection (not having a unit fire through a wall, but waiting until they have a clear line of sight)
- [ ] potentially A* pathfinding
- [ ] proper collisions
